# The Prefrontal Cortex as a Quintessential "Cognitive-type" Neural Circuit -- Wang XJ 2013
## Introduction of basic function and role of prefrontal cortex in brain.
- Mentioned the relationship between pulsatile sensory inputs and persistent and accumulative activities happens in PFC.
- Emphasis the hypothesis that persistent-activity-based working memory mechanism and reward-based decision-making behaviors are potentially resulted from same types of recurrent network structure with excitatory and inhibitory reverberations.

## Biologically based model of working memory
- In oculomotor experiment, a visual cue can generate certain type of persistent activities in cortical network. With this modeling scheme, spatial working memory can be indicated by continuous bumping population activities in network with each neuron labeled by different degrees.
- Strong excitations ensure that firing events persist for a delay periods, which form bump attractors, and synaptic inhibition ensures those active firing activities wouldn't spread far away to sustain the bell shape of bumps.
- Biological constraints: model reveal the homeostatic mechanisms in real cortical network while it has heterogeneity for each single neuron, ie. different labeled orientations.
- Basically, the concept of bump attractor is one of the most potential candidates of working memory. ??

## Slow excitation of reverberations: Role of NMDA receptors
- Fast excitatory and slow inhibitory recurrent circuit would lead to a dynamical instability. While slow excitatory and fast inhibition mediated by NMDAR.
- Sufficiently high NMDA/AMPA ratio would lead to a sustainable firing activity, while the actual ratio value depends on detailed biological structures.

## Multiple feedback process
Three other feedback processes which might participate the generation of persistent spiking activity are mentioned.
1. Positive feedback in individual pyramidal neuron in terms of inducing intrinsic ion current to facilitate the depolarization of membrane potential. In this way, less slow NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission is need to ensure stable persistent activity;
2. In frontal cortex, local synaptic connections between pyramidal neuron pairs shows short-term facilitation in terms of short-term synaptic plasticity, which would persist the localized spiking activation for a certain time period.
3. Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition(DSI). With spike-frequency adaptation, spiking activities would trigger negative feedback process to reduce its firing rate. By introducing DSI, the negative feedback process would be reduced so that spiking activities would maintain for a while. Meanwhile, DSI reduces the noise-induced random drift of the persistent activity pattern.(Not explained in detail) In addition, the paper mentioned a simulated agonist for cannabinoid receptors, which has the opposite contribution compared with DSI.

## Excitation-inhibition balance
### Dynamic stability
Basically, network has a fixed E-I balance regardless of its changing dynamic regime. Meanwhile, inhibition is slightly stronger than excitation.
### Stimulus selectivity
### Resistance against distractors
Unlike in temporal lobe and parietal lobe, neurons in prefrontal cortex might persist spiking activities under external distracting inputs. One of the hypothesis is that active neurons in PFC recruit inhibition to suppress other neurons under the impact of distractors.
